# student-marks-prediction
A simple machine learning project to predict student marks using linear regression


This project uses a simple machine learning model to predict student marks
based on the number of hours studied.

## Project Overview
- Algorithm used: Linear Regression
- Language: Python
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn

## What this project does
- Takes study hours as input
- Trains a linear regression model
- Predicts expected marks

This project is created for learning machine learning fundamentals.
